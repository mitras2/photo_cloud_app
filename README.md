# PhotoCloud App
The PhotoCloud App aims to be a free and open source multi platform frontend for the [OpenPhotoCloud](https://github.com/mitras2/openPhotoCloudServer-Net) and in more time maybe even to more open photo platforms.

## Important
**This Project is currently not maintained as I do not have the time to continue working on it**

*This project is before alpha stage and absolutely not usable for production*
Also i develop this app in my (very rare) spare time. So the development speed 

## Vision and Concept
### Most important Points
- Free/Open source/libre
- Selfhosted server
- Uses only the assigned amount of storage
- Allows sharing of libraries with other users
- Cross platform availability

### Vision/Idea
The idea of the PhotoCloud app is, to provide a free, libre, open source application and server
that empower users to save, share and archive all of their photos in their personal, selfhosted cloud.
The app is connected to one user account on one OpenPhotoCloud Server.
It synchronizes it's data with this server and keeps keeps only images in the required (or configured)
resolution on the device.  
Additionally it will be possible to set a maximum amount of storage to use. 
This assigned amount of storage will be filled with the latest (and favorite) photos. 
Everything else will only be available as a minimal thumbnail for the gallery. 
When watching old images, those files need to e loaded from the server.
This makes it possible to save ALL of your images to your OpenPhotoCloud server without filling you devices storage.

## Technical background
The app is based on the dart language and the flutter framework with the aim to run smooth on devices of most relevant OSs.
Officially this app right now targets iOS, Android, Linux, MacOS and Windows (in this order).

Contribution is highly welcome. To contribute to this project please write a message to me. 
Open source projects need at least a little bit of coordination and this project is in it's initial phase
where decisions weight heavier for the future.
